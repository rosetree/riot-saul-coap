# General Idea

Fetch sensor data via CoAP.

Currently in 3 variants.

# CoAP Resources v1

`GET /saul/cnt`

:   Count of connected saul devices (useful for debugging)

`POST /saul/dev {id}`

:   Information for device with `{id}`

# CoAP Resources v2

Request by supported sensor types. No need for parameters or RIOT
internal ids.

- `GET /temp`
- `GET /hum`
- `GET /press`
- `GET /servo`
- `GET /voltage`

# CoAP Resources v3

Request by *all* sensor types. Need to set `class` parameter to RIOT
interal class id.

`GET /sensor?class=130` (for temperature)

# How to use on your node

Code on [github.com/rosetree/riot-saul-coap](https://github.com/rosetree/riot-saul-coap)

Copy `saul_coap.c` and `make_msg.c` into your project.

Call `saul_coap_init()` from `main()`.

Include used modules into your `Makefile`:

    USEMODULE += gcoap
    USEMODULE += od
    USEMODULE += fmt
    USEMODULE += saul_default

# Questions & Discussion

- PUT saul actuator data (e.g. servo)
- include pkg into riot build system as module
- dynamically registering resources for all sensor types
- select between multiple temperature devices
